    <p>Use PayPal to send money to <b>paypal@prounlockphone.com</b> as gift (select the option to send money to friends or family). Enter the amount you want to deposit in your account and type your username in the message box. This transaction is processed manually and may take some time to be reflected on your balance.<br />You don't have to notify us. You can immediately place your orders regardless of your balance. This option allows full refund of your credits (read our reimbursement policy for further details).
    <br />If by mistake, you select the wrong option during this operation (sending as payment instead of gift), we will contact you and give you the choice to either add the credits to your account by applying the 5% fee policy described in our reimbursement policy, or fully refund the transaction to allow you resend your payment the way you entended to do.
    <hr /><b><u>Note:</u></b><br />This option is not covered by PayPal protection.<br />Nevertheless, we got your back.<br />Buy with confidence.</p>
